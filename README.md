### General Assembly Data Science Immersive Package

This package is a growing collection of classes built by students of the San Francisco dsi6 cohort. 

It currently includes two classes, RegressionMetrics and ClassificationMetrics. In order to use either one, instantiate it as an object. The .fit() method takes a y_true and a y_pred, and builds out the metrics as attributes on the object. In order to return all the metrics at once as a nicely formatted DataFrame, simply call the .describe() method. 

We will continue updating this package as more classes are created.
